# ‚ú® Simple-Calculator ‚ú®

üëâ I built this Simple-Calculator based on the tutorial by Zell Liew on freeCodeCamp:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98/

‚úÖ How It Works:
The Simple Calculator is based on the calculate(n1, operator, n2) function that takes in two numbers and an operator and returns the result which is displayed on the screen. 

‚úÖ The calculator temporarily stores these values as ‚Äúdataset‚Äù attributes in the calculator DOM element: 
1.	firstValue: the first value (n1) to be calculated
2.	operator: the operator to be used in the calculation (plus / minus / multiply / divide)
3.	previousKeyType: the type of button previously pressed (number / operator / calculate / equals / clear). 

‚úÖ When a button is pressed, the calculator will then run a function based on the value and type of button and what previous stored values already exist:
1.	numberInput(): displays the number pressed on the screen
2.	decimalInput(): displays a decimal on the screen only if it does not exist already
3.	operatorInput(): stores the operator, and performs a calculation and displays it if two previous values (n1 and n2) and an operator already exist (for chained calculations)
4.	equalsInput(): performs a calculation and displays it only if two previous values (n1 and n2) and an operator already exist
